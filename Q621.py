## Idea, approach and time complexity:
'''
The problem is about scheduling tasks with a cooldown period, and the goal is to determine the least time to complete all tasks. The approach uses a max-heap to store the 
task frequencies and a queue to manage tasks that are cooling down. At each step, the most frequent task is selected, and itâ€™s re-added to the queue with an updated 
cooldown. The process continues until all tasks are completed. Time complexity is O(T * log A), where T is the number of tasks and A is the number of distinct task types. 
This is because each task can be pushed and popped from the heap, and each task can be processed at most once.
