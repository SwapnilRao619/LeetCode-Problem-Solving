## N
## Idea, approach and time complexity:
'''
The solution determines if one string, `goal`, can be derived from another string, `s`, through left rotations. It uses a helper function to perform the rotation and 
iterates through all possible rotations of `s`, checking each configuration against `goal`. If a match is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` after 
exhausting all possibilities. The overall time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of `s`, due to the nested checks for each rotation.
