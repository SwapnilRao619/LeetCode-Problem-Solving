## N
## Idea, approach and time complexity:
'''
The given solution computes the **minimum number of deletions** required to make two strings equal by leveraging the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**. The core idea 
is that characters not part of the LCS must be deleted from either string. The `lcs` method uses dynamic programming to build a 2D table that stores the actual LCS 
strings for all prefixes of `word1` and `word2`. Once the LCS is obtained, the number of deletions needed is the sum of the characters in both strings that are not part 
of the LCS, calculated as `(len(word1) - len(LCS)) + (len(word2) - len(LCS))`. The time and space complexity of the solution is **O(m Ã— n)**, where `m` and `n` are the 
lengths of the two input strings, due to the nested loops and 2D table storage.
