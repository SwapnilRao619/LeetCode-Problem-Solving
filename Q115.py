## Idea, approach and time complexity:
'''
The given solution calculates the number of distinct subsequences of string `s` that equal string `t` using dynamic programming. It constructs a 2D DP table `t` where 
`t[i][j]` represents the number of ways the first `j` characters of `t` can be formed using the first `i` characters of `s`. The base case initializes the first column 
as 1 since an empty `t` can be formed from any prefix of `s` by deleting all characters. For each character in `s` and `t`, if they match, the DP value is the sum of the 
values by including or excluding the current character of `s`; otherwise, it's just the value from excluding the character. This approach ensures that all subsequences 
are considered. The time and space complexity of the solution are both **O(m Ã— n)**, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.
